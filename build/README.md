# Build scripts for container definition files

This folder contains scripts and other files to create (or assist in creating) definition files needed to build Rocker container images.

## Overview

The Dockerfiles for pre-build images will be generated by executing the scripts in the following order. It will also generate the `docker-compose.yml` files that can be used to build the container images.

1. `./build/sync-template-vars.R`
2. `./build/make-stacks.R`
3. `./build/make-dockerfiles.R`
4. `./build/write-compose.R`

These scripts are run daily by GitHub Actions and automatically create a Pull Request if the run results in a variance from the default branch.
